    <p>
      High Point University Baseball is coming off a historic, record-setting 2025 campaign.
      The Panthers finished 39–19 overall and 18–6 in Big South play, securing the top conference
      position and earning national recognition for one of the most explosive offenses in college baseball.
      Ranking among the top teams nationally in plate appearances per game, HPU produced multiple NCAA
      statistical leaders and one of the strongest offensive seasons in program history.
    </p>

    <p>
      Junior infielder <strong>Landen Johnson</strong> led the charge with a .355 average, 75 hits,
      18 doubles, 14 home runs, and 78 RBIs — finishing <strong>3rd in the NCAA</strong>.  
      Senior outfielder <strong>Brayden Simpson</strong> collected 24 doubles, while 
      <strong>Konni Durschlag</strong> posted a staggering <strong>.434 AVG</strong> and 23 doubles
      to finish among the nation’s best hitters.  
      <strong>Miggy Echazarreta</strong> added 17 doubles, rounding out a lineup that consistently
      pressured opposing pitching staffs.  
      On the mound, <strong>Brody Shawn</strong> contributed a key 1–0 record as part of the staff’s depth.
    </p>

    <p>
      Recognized by D1Baseball and the NCAA with a top-100 RPI ranking, HPU Baseball continues to build
      a championship-caliber foundation driven by analytics, development, and elite team culture.

    <p>
      My name is <strong>Brody Shawn</strong>, and I am proud to be a member of the High Point University
      baseball program. Along with contributing on the field, I also serve in a leadership role as the team’s

      My work centers around using data to enhance player development, optimize strategy, and support scouting.
      I specialize in data collection, visualization, and performance analysis — helping bridge the gap between
      advanced metrics and on-field execution.
