      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>My name is <strong>Brody Shawn</strong>, and I'm proud to be a part of the High Point University baseball program. I've had the opportunity to both play for the Panthers and contribute to the team in a leadership role off the field as an <strong>Analytics Director</strong>.</p>
      <p>Through my work in baseball analytics, I've focused on using data to enhance player performance, strategy, and scouting. I've gained valuable experience in data collection, visualization, and analysis—skills that help bridge the gap between technology and athletics.</p>
      <p>Being part of HPU Baseball has taught me the importance of teamwork, preparation, and innovation. I'm passionate about combining my background in baseball with my analytical skills to continue driving success for the team and my future career in sports analytics.</p>
